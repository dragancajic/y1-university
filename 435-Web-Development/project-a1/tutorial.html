              Remote learning can be difficult for a lot of students. It
              requires you to be more proactive, take initiative in your own
              learning, and be ready to ask questions if needed. Additionally,
              whereas with lectures and in-person lessons, it's more difficult
              to get into the right mindset with learning. For these reasons,
              it's important to learn how to work effectively while remote
              learning.
            </p>
            <p>
              This guide aims to help you achieve success in these times by
              giving you some ideas on how to improve your workflow, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Physically and mentally separating your work space and fun
                space.
              </li>
              <li>
                Preventing any distractions from compromising your workflow.
              </li>
              <li>Properly structuring your time.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Following these tips isn't going to fix every issue, but it will
              certainly push you in the right direction when it comes to
              studying in these times and in this environment.
            </p>

            <p>
              Properly utilising your time while studying is important. With
              remote learning comes difficulty with scheduling and organisation,
              as your work space and home space fuse. What's important, in these
              times, is to still try to divide these spaces as much as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, dividing the space you have into various physical
              areas, such as having an area for watching TV, an area for cooking
              and eating, and an area for working, can greatly improve your
              productivity. It can be difficult to stick to, but having this
              physical compartmentalisation can get you in the right frame of
              mind just by sitting down in the right place.
            </p>
            <p>
              If space is hard to come by, say if an area is shared between a
              few of these activities, that's alright! There are other methods
              of compartmentalising, including setting up multiple user accounts
              on your computer, or scheduling time for work and time for fun.
              Stopping yourself from deviating while focussing and working is
              difficult, but it can improve your focus and increase the quality
              of your study.
            </p>

            <p>
              Work can pile up quickly, even at the best of times. Keeping on
              track with work can be difficult, and as such, the importance
              behind keeping on top of your deadlines and assignments is
              compounded during Lockdown. The single best thing you can do to
              counter this is to set a goal for yourself to study work some
              amount each day. It doesn't have to be much, but skipping out
              entirely can leave you behind, confused, with work piling up. Even
              a small amount of work each day can help you stay in the loop.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, distractions can have a hugely detrimental effect to
              your work during these times. Even at the best of times, having
              your focus taken away by a notification of an email or a group
              chat can ruin any flow that you have while working. For this
              reason, it might be best to set up some kind of do-not-disturb
              mode on your phone or computer, allowing you to get into a flow
              while working.
            </p>

              These times are anything but normal. You've probably heard that
              saying many times over, but I feel it's worth reiterating. Even
              with a perfect work ethic and structure, it's likely that you'll
              not be working at your best, if you can even find the time and
              energy to work at all. That's okay! This literally is a global
              crisis, and it's okay to not feel your best. It's totally okay to
              not do your best at the moment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Learning to cope with mistakes and failure is a lifelong skill,
              one that's very difficult to acquire. It may seem unhelpful to say
              "Don't worry about messing up" when there's potentially a lot
              riding on you succeeding at the moment, but I feel as though a
              reminder like this could help: the fact that you're trying is
              enough. The fact that you're still making progress, however
              slight, right now, is impressive.
