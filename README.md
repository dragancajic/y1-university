![Usage Notes](.github/usage.png)

### CI410

This section features a LaTeX document that must be prepared using `texlive` (or equivalent). My method involves using `texlive` and `biber`, both available on Ubuntu and Pop!\_OS's default 20.10 repositories, which is what I use. The process for building this document by yourself may differ depending on your OS! This being said, there's a copy of the report available in the [CI410 Releases Tag](https://github.com/summerysaturn/y1-university/releases/tag/CI410), under the 'Assignment 1 Essay'.

### CI435

This section features a static site. This site is viewable at <http://ci435-01.kmjw10.brighton.domains/index.html>. An additional copy may be hosted on GitHub Pages in the future.
